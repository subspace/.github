# Subspace Foundation

The Subspace Foundation, established in June 2023, is the driving force behind the Autonomys Network - a cutting-edge instance of the Subspace protocol designed for web3 x AI infrastructure.

Our mission is clear: to promote, develop, and ultimately decentralize the Autonomys Network. We're committed to fostering a thriving ecosystem of farmers, operators, nominators, developers, and token holders through strategic grants, treasury management, and community engagement.

Led by a diverse five-member council, we're executing a progressive decentralization roadmap. Our goal? To transition from our current structure to a fully decentralized, community-driven DAO, ensuring the network's future lies in the hands of its users.

Join us in shaping the future of decentralized infrastructure. Together, we're building a foundation for innovation, transparency, and community-powered growth.
